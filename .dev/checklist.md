# Deferred Work Checklist

Open items only. Resolved items removed (see git history).
Check at session start for items that become actionable.
Prefix: W## (to distinguish from CW's F## items).

## Invariants (always enforce)

- [ ] D100: No CW-specific types in public API (Value, GC, Env)
- [ ] D102: All types take allocator parameter, no global allocator

## Open items

- [x] W30: JIT out-of-bounds on complex real-world programs — **FIXED**
  Root cause: four JIT codegen bugs:
  1. Guard page recovery not saved/restored across nested JIT calls (SIGBUS crashes)
  2. instrDefinesRd wrong for global.set/memory.fill/memory.copy (rd is USE not DEF)
  3. computeCalleeSavedLiveSet missing rd-as-USE and select condition vreg
  4. x86 emitCall: liveness-aware spill/reload left garbage in physical registers
  Mac + Ubuntu: spec 62,263/62,263, E2E 792/792, compat 50/50 (Ubuntu).
- [x] W31: Intermittent ARM64 JIT crash in Go wasm programs — **NOT A BUG**
  Root cause: go_crypto_sha256 test had wrong expected SHA-256 hash values.
  Fix: corrected expected hash for "Hello, SHA-256!" in main.go.
  50/50 PASS (go_crypto_sha256 + go_regex) after fix. No JIT bug.
