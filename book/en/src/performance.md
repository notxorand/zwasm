# Performance

## Execution tiers

zwasm uses tiered execution:

1. **Interpreter**: All functions start as register IR, executed by a dispatch loop. Fast startup, no compilation overhead.
2. **JIT (ARM64/x86_64)**: Hot functions are compiled to native code when call count or back-edge count exceeds a threshold.

### When JIT kicks in

- **Call threshold**: After ~8 calls to the same function
- **Back-edge counting**: Hot loops trigger JIT faster (loop iterations count toward the threshold)
- **Adaptive**: The threshold adjusts based on function characteristics

Once JIT-compiled, all subsequent calls to that function execute native machine code directly, bypassing the interpreter.

## Binary size and memory

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Binary size (ReleaseSafe) | ~1.2 MB |
| Runtime memory (fib benchmark) | ~3.5 MB RSS |
| wasmtime binary for comparison | 56.3 MB |

zwasm is ~40x smaller than wasmtime.

## Benchmark results

Representative benchmarks comparing zwasm against wasmtime 41.0.1, Bun 1.3.8, and Node v24.13.0 on Apple M4 Pro.
16 of 29 benchmarks match or beat wasmtime. 25/29 within 1.5x.

| Benchmark | zwasm | wasmtime | Bun | Node |
|-----------|------:|---------:|----:|-----:|
| nqueens(8) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 14 ms | 23 ms |
| nbody(1M) | 22 ms | 22 ms | 32 ms | 36 ms |
| gcd(12K,67K) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 14 ms | 23 ms |
| tak(24,16,8) | 5 ms | 9 ms | 17 ms | 29 ms |
| sieve(1M) | 5 ms | 7 ms | 17 ms | 29 ms |
| fib(35) | 46 ms | 51 ms | 36 ms | 52 ms |
| st_fib2 | 900 ms | 674 ms | 353 ms | 389 ms |

zwasm uses 3-4x less memory than wasmtime and 8-10x less than Bun/Node.

### SIMD performance

SIMD (v128) operations are JIT-compiled to native NEON (ARM64, 253/256 opcodes) and SSE
(x86_64, 244/256 opcodes). v128 values are stored as split 64-bit halves in the register file.

| Benchmark              | zwasm scalar | zwasm SIMD | wasmtime SIMD | SIMD speedup |
|------------------------|-------------:|-----------:|--------------:|-------------:|
| image_blend (128x128)  | 73 ms        | 16 ms      | 12 ms         | **4.7x**     |
| matrix_mul (16x16)     | 10 ms        | 6 ms       | 8 ms          | **1.6x**     |
| byte_search (64KB)     | 52 ms        | 43 ms      | 5 ms          | **1.2x**     |
| dot_product (4096)     | 142 ms       | 190 ms     | 15 ms         | 0.75x        |

matrix_mul beats wasmtime. image_blend within 1.3x. dot_product is slower due to
v128.load-heavy inner loop and split storage overhead.

Compiler-generated SIMD code (C `-msimd128`) shows larger gaps due to patterns like
`i16x8.replace_lane` that are expensive with split v128 storage. Future work: contiguous
v128 register storage (W37) to eliminate this overhead.

## Benchmark methodology

All measurements use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) with ReleaseSafe builds:

```bash
# Quick check (1 run, no warmup)
bash bench/run_bench.sh --quick

# Full measurement (3 runs, 1 warmup)
bash bench/run_bench.sh

# Record to history
bash bench/record.sh --id="X" --reason="description"
```

| Shootout   | 5  | Sightglass shootout suite (WASI)                             |
| Real-world | 6  | Rust, C, C++ compiled to Wasm (matrix, math, string, sort)   |
| GC         | 2  | GC proposal: struct allocation, tree traversal               |
| SIMD       | 10 | WAT microbench (4) + C -msimd128 real-world (5), scalar/SIMD |

### CI regression detection

PRs are automatically checked for performance regressions:
- 6 representative benchmarks run on both base and PR branch
- Fails if any benchmark regresses by more than 20%
- Same runner ensures fair comparison

## Performance tips

- **ReleaseSafe**: Always use for production. Debug is 5-10x slower.
- **Hot functions**: Functions called frequently will be JIT-compiled automatically.
- **Fuel limit**: `--fuel` adds overhead per instruction. Only use for untrusted code.
- **Memory**: Wasm modules with linear memory allocate guard pages. Initial RSS is ~3.5 MB regardless of module size.
